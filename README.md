# Netflix Movie Duration Analysis

**Analyzing Trends in Movie Lengths on Netflix**

This project explores the Netflix movie catalog to investigate whether the average duration of movies has been declining over time. It uses a dataset of Netflix movies and TV shows to perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) and visualization to uncover trends in movie lengths.

## How to Run the Project

1. **Dependencies:** Make sure you have the following Python libraries installed:
   ```bash
   pip install pandas matplotlib
   ```

2. **Data:** Download the `netflix_data.csv` dataset and place it in the same directory as the Jupyter Notebook.

3. **Run:** Open the `netflix_movie_analysis.ipynb` notebook in a Jupyter environment (e.g., Jupyter Notebook, JupyterLab, Google Colab) and run the cells to execute the code.

## Analysis Steps

The project performs the following analysis steps:

* **Data Loading and Cleaning:** Loads the dataset and checks for missing values.
* **Movie Filtering:** Filters the data to include only movies.
* **Genre Analysis:** Explores the distribution of movie genres and assigns colors for visualization.
* **Duration Trend:** Calculates and plots the average movie duration for each release year to visualize trends over time.

## Results

The analysis aims to answer the question of whether movie lengths on Netflix are getting shorter. The findings will be presented in the Jupyter Notebook through visualizations and textual descriptions.
